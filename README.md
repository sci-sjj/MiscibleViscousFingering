# Miscible Viscous Fingering

Simulation files and image analysis files for Miscible Viscous Fingering in a Quarter five-spot cell.

The files are to support the paper 'The effect of viscosity ratio and Peclet number on miscible viscous fingering in a Hele-Shaw cell: A combined numerical and experimental study' by Keable et al. 2021.

The image analysis and plotting files require data to be downloaded from the Zenodo repository at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5567913 

A0_1.. and A0_2.. files perform experimental and simulation image analysis processing, respectively. 
A1_... files perform plotting/analysis for the figures in the paper. The requires datasets are listed in the top of each file (e.g. addpath('x')) which must be copied into the working directory.  

Simulation files are given by ... and can be run using the MISTRESS code. To download the most recent development version of the MISTRESS code contact Ann Muggeridge  - a.muggeridge@imperial.ac.uk
